# h5 Laboratorio- ja simulaatioympäristöt hyökkäyksissä

## a) Evilginx

WIP

## b) Mininet

To start this task i downloaded VMware Workstation through the link that was provided on moodle. I had to create an account for the website in order to get the download link so after that i completed downloading my VMWare Workstation.
After this i downloaded Mininet disk file that was also provided in moodle under the homework task.
Then all i had to do was to open my VMware and click on "Open a Virtual Machine" then choose the disk file that we downloaded.
Lastly i powered it up and it asked me for login so i typed mininet/mininet.
Seems to work!
