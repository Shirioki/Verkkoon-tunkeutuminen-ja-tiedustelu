#H6 wifichallengelab

I started the homework by downloading WiFiChallengeLabv2.1-VMware.zip.001, .002 and .003. After this i had to extract the these three files in order to get VMware virtual disk file. I used 7zip to do this. This created
a folder with these items inside of it.

After this i opened virtual machine which created Wifichallengelab for us.

I logged into user account using "user" password. 

With a little bit of snooping i noticed that the lab already have some tools like WireShark and when i opened firefox it opened nzyme - Wifi defense system.

In the user folder i noticed there is 2 .sh files "restartWiFi.sh" and "updateWiFiChallengeLab.sh" so i went to terminal and ran "updateWiFiChallengeLab.sh"

Now my WifiChallengeLab-containers are in running/started status which means the environment is ready to use!

After this I realized all of this was pointless lol. 

I registered into WifiChallenge page that was linked in moodle then started doing the exercises.
